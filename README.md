# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques üè°

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. By analyzing a dataset with over 80 features related to house characteristics, we explore feature engineering, machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning, and data visualization to deliver accurate and insightful predictions.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the dataset.
   - Handle missing values using imputation.
   - Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Analyze feature importance to select the most impactful predictors.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models on preprocessed data.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV`.

4. **Prediction and Evaluation**:
   - Predict house prices on the test set.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like **R¬≤** and **Mean Absolute Error**.

5. **Dashboard**:
   - Launch the interactive dashboard:
     ```bash
     python dashboard.py
     ```

## Key Insights

- Neighborhood and square footage are significant predictors of house prices.
- Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved model performance by optimizing learning rate, max depth, and the number of estimators.

## Visualization Examples

- **Correlation Matrix**:
  Visualizing relationships between features to identify collinear variables.
- **Feature Importance**:
  Bar plots showing the most critical factors influencing house prices.
- **Interactive Plots**:
  Scatter plots and histograms in the dashboard for exploring data distribution.

## Future Work

- Explore other regression techniques such as **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**.
- Incorporate additional external data (e.g., location-specific economic factors).
- Improve the dashboard with more interactive widgets and charts.
